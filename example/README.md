# animatorfilter_example

Demonstrates how to use the animatorfilter plugin.

## PoC

Proof of concept displaying an imagestream from the camera using the preview from 
the  animatorfilter  plugin. 

The  plugin creates a cusstom camera preview and displays images streamed from  the  camera.

This will show the performance on Android devices. 

A further version will run OpenGL shader/chromakey logic.

The plugin also saves rendered images to the device for later construction of video output.
